# Welcome to CPAN-228 🎓
## Web Application Development for CPAN Diploma
### Lab 0: GitHub Fundamentals + Spring Dependency Injection

---

## 🚀 What is This Repository?

Welcome! This is your **Lab 0 starter repository** for CPAN-252. Here you'll learn:
- How to use GitHub and Git professionally
- How to submit your work via Pull Requests
- Spring Boot fundamentals (Dependency Injection, IoC Container)

By the end of Lab 0, you'll have:
- ✅ Created your first GitHub pull request
- ✅ Built a Spring application demonstrating DI
- ✅ Understood the Spring Container

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours  
**Difficulty:** Beginner (first time? follow step-by-step!)

## 📋 Lab 0 Overview

Lab 0 has **2 parts**:

### Part 1: GitHub Setup & First Pull Request (30 minutes)
Learn the GitHub workflow:
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Add your name to the submissions file
4. Create and submit a Pull Request
5. Have it reviewed and merged

**Why?** You'll submit ALL labs via GitHub. This is practice!

### Part 2: Spring Dependency Injection Exercise (2 hours)
Build a Task Validation System:
1. Create domain models (User, Task)
2. Implement services with Spring annotations
3. Use Dependency Injection (@Autowired)
4. Run the application and see DI in action

**Why?** DI is the foundation of Spring. Everything else builds on this!
